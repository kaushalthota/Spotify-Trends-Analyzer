This project is a data analytics and visualization tool that processes Spotify listening data to uncover trends and user behavior patterns. It uses a simulated dataset of listening activity from January to April 2025, and analyzes key metrics such as most played artists, peak listening hours, and monthly engagement. This type of analysis is useful for product teams, marketing strategists, and music platform developers looking to derive insights from user interaction data.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.9+. Used as the core language for scripting and data analysis. 

Libraries and Frameworks.
Pandas: For data loading, manipulaton, and time-based feature extraction.
Matplotlib:For creating static visualizations such as bar and line plots.
Seaborn: For enchanced visual styling and readability of charts. 

CSV File: The dataset is stored in a CSV file named spotify_sample_data.csv, which simulates real-world Spotify listening behavior.

Top Artists Analysis: Identifies and visualizes the 10 most played artists.

Listening Activity by Hour: Shows user listening trends by hour of the day.

Monthly Trend Visualization: Analyzes and plots how engagement changes month to month.

Summary Report: Automatically generates a text file summarizing the top artist, top genre, peak listening hour, and the most active month.
